This project uses machine learning to predict apartment prices in Bangalore based on features like location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms.
We performed data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and built models including Random Forest (RÂ² = 0.81).
The final model is deployed via Docker and accessible through a simple web interface.
